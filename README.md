# 📖 Introduction

This project is a **Simple Translator**, inspired by introductory concepts in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Linguistics**.  
The program maintains a lexicon of **language–translation pairs** and allows the user to manage data and perform machine translation of text or files.

It simulates real-world translation systems by storing up to:

- **150 entries**
- **10 language–translation pairs per entry**
- **20 characters max** per language or translation

This project includes:  
✔ Data management  
✔ Searching  
✔ File import/export  
✔ Text translation  
✔ Tokenization  
✔ Menu-driven interface

# Features Overview

## Manage Data Menu

### Add Entry
- Input a **language–translation** pair
- If entries with that pair exist → show them
- User is asked if they want to create a **new entry**
- Add additional pairs until user stops (max 10)

---

### Add Translations
- Input a **language–translation** pair
- If no entry exists → prompt user to use *Add Entry*
- If one entry exists → allow adding pairs to that entry
- If multiple entries exist → choose which entry to add to
- Prevent adding if entry already has **10 pairs**

---

### Delete Entry
- Display all entries
- Choose entry number to delete
- Invalid inputs give error messages
- Entire entry is removed

---

### Delete Translation
- Select an entry
- Select which translation pair to delete
- If entry has only **one pair**, deleting it removes the entire entry
- Input validation ensures safe deletion

---

### Display All Entries
- Show entries **one at a time**
- Pairs sorted alphabetically by language (ASCII)
- Entries sorted by presence of **English**
- Navigate via:
  - `N` = next  
  - `P` = previous  
  - `X` = exit view

---

### Search Word
- Input a translation (e.g., *mahal*)
- Shows all entries containing that word
- Navigation same as *Display All Entries*

---

### Search Translation
- Input **language + translation**
- Shows all entries containing that exact pair

---

### Export
- Save all entries to a text file
- File format must follow exact required layout
- Filename must be ≤ **30 characters** (including extension)
- Overwrites existing files

---

### Import
- Load entries from exported text file
- For each entry:
  - User decides to **add** or **skip**
- Does NOT assume entries are sorted in file

---

### Exit Manage Data
- Returns to Main Menu
- All unsaved data is cleared  

---

# Translate Menu

Before translation begins, the user loads a file (similar to Import).

---

## Translate Text Input
- User provides:
  - Source language
  - Text (≤150 chars)
  - Target language
- Tokenizes input (splits by spaces)
- Removes punctuation (.,!?)
- Performs word-level translation
- Unknown words remain unchanged
- If multiple translations exist → first encountered is used
- User may translate multiple texts in a row

---

## Translate Text File
- User provides:
  - Source language
  - Input filename
  - Target language
  - Output filename
- File may contain multiple sentences
- Sentences end with `.`, `?`, `!`
- Each translated sentence is:
  - Displayed
  - Saved into the output file (one sentence per line)

---

## Exit Translate Menu
- Clears loaded translation data
- Returns to Main Menu

---

# Restrictions (IMPORTANT)

You are **NOT allowed** to use:

- ❌ Global variables  
- ❌ `goto`  
- ❌ `break` or `continue` (except to exit switch cases)  
- ❌ `return` to exit loops prematurely  
- ❌ `exit()` to quit function/menu  
- ❌ Calling `main()` to restart program  

Program must follow:

- `gcc -Wall -std=C99`
- Variables declared at start of functions
- Proper documentation and readable coding style

---

# Testing & Submission Requirements

### Must Submit:
- ✔ Source code  
- ✔ Test script (table format, 3 categories per function)  
- ✔ Sample exported text file  
- ✔ Internal documentation with certification header  

### Test cases must cover:
- Valid inputs  
- Edge cases  
- Error handling
